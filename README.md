Pure SwiftUI routing with transitions, animations, and `.sheet()` support.

In SwiftUI, View is a function of the state. Routing is not an exception. Reasoning and under the hood explanation can be found on my blog: 

http://alexdremov.me/swiftui-navigation-is-a-mess-heres-what-you-can-do/

## Why
- `.sheet()` usages are usually messy, deviate from app architecture, and require additional business-logic
- Creating view sequences in SwiftUI is not elegant
- MVVM is gorgeous, but what about one level above? Routing between MVVM modules is cluttered.

## Advantages
- **Purely state-driven**.
No ObservableObjects, no EnvironmentObjects, no Singletons.
- **Pure SwiftUI**.
- **SwiftUI transitions and animations**.
- **Structured `.sheet()` support**.
No need to remaster the whole codebase to present the view with `.sheet()`. It just works.

## Example

Example from the video: [PathPresenterExample](https://github.com/AlexRoar/PathPresenterExample/tree/main)

The view hierarchy is managed through the `PathPresenter.Path()` structure.
You can push new views into it using `.append` methods and delete views from the top using `.removeLatest`.

Internally, the view's layout is managed by `ZStack`, so all views history is visible.

Possible presentation ways:
```swift
enum PathType {
  /**
   * Just show a view. No animation, no transition.
   * Show view above all other views
   */
  case plain
  
  /**
   * Show view with in and out transitions.
   * Transition animation also can be specified.
   */
  case animated(transition: AnyTransition, animation: Animation)
  
  /**
   * Show view in .sheet()
   * - Note: If you want to present several views in sheet,
   * you can create a second RoutingView and use it in sheet!
   */
  case sheet(onDismiss: Action)
}
```

## TODO
- **Path-based routing**. Define view hierarchy with URL-like structures for better views switching architecture
